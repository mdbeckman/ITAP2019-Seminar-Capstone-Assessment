# Assessment Outline  

- **Goal: Measure learning outcomes of students upon completion of undergraduate statistics program (e.g. major)**
    - snapshot of student learning outcomes  
    - facilitate cohort comparisons for program evaluation 
    - comprehensive scope
- Constraints
    - closely aligned to (2014) ASA Curriculum Guidelines[^1]
    - ease of use across institutions, instructors, years 
- Outcomes
    - two capstone assessment tools (i.e., test & survey)
    - multi-year pilot
    - good psychometric quality

# (2014) ASA Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Sciences

![](ASA Guidelines.png){ width=95% }


# Comprehensive Undergraduate Statistics Program (CUSP) Assessment Strategy

- [Test Blueprint (Link)](https://bit.ly/2lGxurK)
- 95 competencies cited in 2014 ASA Guidelines  
- single assessment tool likely not sufficient


| # Competencies | ASA Guidelines Topic | 
|:--------------:|:-----------|
| 37 |  Statistical Methods & Theory |
| 16 |  Data Wrangling, Computing, & Data Science |
| 11 |  Mathematical Foundations |
| 18 |  Statistical Practice |
| 9  | Problem Solving |
| 4  | Discipline-Specific Knowledge |

# Comprehensive Undergraduate Statistics Program (CUSP) Assessments

- Indirect assessment--CUSP Survey
    - inventory of all 95 competancies cited in ASA Guidelines  
    - survey data self-reported by students
    - approx. 10-15 minutes duration
    - several cohorts from single institution 
- Direct assessment--CUSP Test
    - selected response test
    - approx. 1 hour duration
    - multiple institutions w. single cohort
    - single institution w. multiple cohorts


# Indirect assessment--CUSP Survey 

- **Benefits**
    - Easy implementation
    - Can be administered multiple times if desired  
    - No problem including topics we don't teach
    - Includes demographics
- **Risks/Issues**
    - Reliability of self-reporting 
    - Over/Underconfidence with content exposure

### Excerpt

# Example Use 

- Indirect assessment tool (i.e., Survey) administered at key program milestones
    - first-year seminar
    - midpoint course(s)--if possible
    - beginning & end of capstone course
- informative for annual program evaluation data


# Note to self

# Direct assessment--CUSP Test

- Selected response assessment tool with broad coverage
- 33 tasks; some with multiple parts
    - 9 testlets  
    - 24 conventional MC questions
- several tasks/subtasks assess multiple competancies
    - score adjustment for successive competancies (1, 1/2, 1/4, ...)
    - 86 points possible
- some tasks adpted from other instruments (with permission)
    - 2 from the REGRESS assessment[^2] 
    - 9 from the CAOS assessment[^3]

### Excerpt (partial item)

# CUSP Test

- **Benefits**
    - test statistical "reflexes" of students
    - built-in "CAOS" subtest
    - objective measure of student competancies
        - for individual students
        - for a cohort of students
        - aggregate useful for program evaluation
    - Easy implementation
- **Risks/Issues**
    - Variable use conditions may jeopardize comparisons
    - Scope constrained by test fatigue
    - Includes topics we don't necessarily teach
    - Longer to implement 



# Example Use Cases

- Penn State
    - Indirect assessment tool (i.e., Survey) administered pre & post (in addition to first-year students)
    - Direct assessment tool (i.e., test) positioned as a midterm in the capstone course
    - benchmarking student skills and competancies against ASA Guidelines
    - allows several weeks to address areas of need prior to graduation
    - useful for annual program evaluation data
- Other Institutions
    - no course credit
    - homework, extra credit, etc
    - typically open notes

> Sorry to interrupt again--especially since it really wasn't even funny the first time--but I can't resist pointing out another great opportunity to pause for some discussion!

# Preliminary Item Functioning Analysis

- Benchmarks for item statistics[^4]
    - Unidimensionality assumed by common methods of assessment evaluation
    - Cronbach alpha (reliability)
    - descrimination > 0.15 preferred 
    - 0.6 < proportion correct < 0.9
- Results
    - PCA evidence supports unidimensionality
    - Cronbach alpha = 0.81
    - 30/33 items with discrimination > 0.15
    - 9/33 items in recommended difficulty range
    - 21/33 items with > 50% correct

# Item discrimination

- Item discrimination < 0.15
    - (21% correct) Validity of models aligned to a study design
    - (3.6% correct) Strategies to maximize likelihood
    - (40% correct) CAOS task about CI interpretation
- Best item discrimination
    - (discrim = 0.59) Probability distributions task 
    - (discrim = 0.50) Histograms & std deviation task
    - (discrim = 0.46) OLS regression assumptions task

# Future work

### Shorter term goals

- Post-graduation follow-up for validation evidence
- Streamline logistics for wider implementation 
- Link CUSP Survey data to CUSP Test outcomes
- Expand item bank

### Longer term goals

- Experimentation with short/long forms
- Alternative or additional tools for more complete alignment to ASA Guidelines
