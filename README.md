## Novel assessment tools for improving learning: Early lessons from statistics

*November 8, 2019*

## Abstract

This work introduces new assessment tools to measure student learning outcomes in undergraduate statistics programs using competencies recommended by a national organization, the American Statistical Association. These assessment tools seek to: (1) measure student learning outcomes with respect to program objectives; (2) discover whether students are gaining additional relevant competencies not explicitly included in the program/major through extracurricular experiences; (3) facilitate comparisons across years and institutions to benefit continuous improvement of the program/major. I will present results from piloting with Senior/Capstone undergraduate statistics students at four different institutions around the US. I will conclude by sharing goals and challenges for future work and facilitate a conversation about how this approach can be adapted to other disciplines.
